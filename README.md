# Survey Analysis of Developer Landscape in 2022

This project analyzes the results from a 2022 survey to provide insights into the current landscape of software developers around the world. The survey data provides rich information on aspects such as location of developers, programming languages in use and desired to be learned, remote work tendencies, education attainment, how developers learned to code by age range, and the relationship between years of professional coding and total annual salary.
